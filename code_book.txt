See the main description for the input data in UCI HAR Dataset directory

The output data frame contains following columns.

subject - id for the subject the data was generated from and it goes from 1 to 30
activity - Different activities performed by the subject
	 WALKING
	 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	 SITTING
	 STANDING
	 LAYING


These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
